# Check for Multiple Zoom Installations
In a multi-user environment, if an older version of Zoom is installed on a dormant user, Filewave will detect it and continually consider that user out of date.

This script checks for such instances without removing anything and will send a webhook to your Slack or Google Hangouts chat bot.
